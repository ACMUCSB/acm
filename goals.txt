-- TO DO --
- Figure out how to compress the SASS css output. No point in keeping it the way it is now.
- The header nav is too close to the event slider. How can we differentiate them?




--GOALS--
When you come up with ideas add them here.
--SHORT TERM--
	contact page
		-email address(could be changed later to acmblah@domainName.com)
		-phone(maybe not?)
		-email form...who it is from, sender's email, subject, and message boxes.
	index page
		-get people to write the html/erb to get general features.
		-if someone is interested in design/layout they tackle this part. CSS or SASS, javascript, I don't know...
		-a simple, classy design with a nice type face...comic sans? lulz
		things we may want to include on the landing page:
			-upcoming event
			-tech/acm news
			-polls
			-login
	mailing list
		-ability to sign up (has some type of captcha/email validation)
		-ability to remove yourself from the list

	about us page

	calendar/events page
                - event notifications (email, SMS, whatever)

	a more complete, well organized user database schema
--LONG TERM--
	user forum
		-tech talk
		-hardware discussion
		-software discussion
		-troubleshooting/tuts/help
		-general
		-announcements

	different stylesheets users can choose from

	increased security...depends if anyone is interested in this kind of thing.

	optimized search because no one likes slow crappy searches

	After I log in I would like some way to find and view other peoples info. I would like to be able to see year, major, name,
	email, phone, general info, skills, etc.(users can choose what they want to share). If this information is available it is easier
	to get in contact with people and possibly get help with stuff.

	Notifications
		-email
		-text
		-some way to stop getting the texts and emails

stuff to fix in the future
==========================
- dealing with shared folder -- bad... too little differences between forum and app layout
- get rid of lots of useless shit
